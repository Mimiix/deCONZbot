These are the rules you **MUST** follow in order to get support from the members. 

Feel free to introduce yourself, as we are all friends here.
Do not insult, belittle, or abuse your fellow community members. Any reports of abuse will not be taken lightly and will lead to a ban.



A few more **important things** to remember:

1. A maximum of 10-15 lines of code can be posted. For code that is more than 15 lines, please use https://paste.ubuntu.com
2. Please make sure you format the code when pasting. Use markdown language when pasting code.
3. Please read the #information and #faq channels first. Those contain allot of information!
4. Don't tag people to request help, it tends to come across poorly, like you're demanding help. Keep tagging for thanking people for help, or if there's overlapping conversations going on.
